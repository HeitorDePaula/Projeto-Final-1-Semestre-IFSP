        <h1>What is Global Warming?</h1>

        <p>Global warming can be defined as the process of average rise in Earth's temperatures over
            of
            time. According to most scientific studies and climate panel reports, its occurrence
            would be
            being accelerated by human activities, causing atmospheric and ocean level problems, thanks to
            to
            melting of polar ice caps.

            The main body responsible for disseminating data and information on Global Warming is the Panel
            on Climate Change (IPCC), a body linked to the United Nations (UN).
            according to
            IPCC, the 20th century was the warmest in recent times, with an average increase of 0.7ºC in temperatures
            in
            the entire terrestrial globe. The estimate, according to the same organ, is that temperatures will continue to rise to the
            throughout the 21st century if actions to contain the problem are not adopted on a large scale.

            The IPCC basically works with two scenarios: one optimistic and the other pessimistic. In the first, considering that
            O
            human being can reduce the emission of pollutants in the atmosphere and contain deforestation actions, the
            temperatures would rise by 1°C by 2100. In the second scenario, temperatures could rise by 1.8
            up until
            4ºC during this same period, which would compromise a good part of human activities.

            In a high-profile report published in March 2014, the IPCC states that global warming
            would be
            very serious and irreversible, causing the elevation of the oceans, agricultural losses, among other countless
            catastrophes generated by changes in the climate and in the disposition of elements and natural resources.

        <h1>Consequences of Global Warming</h1>

        <p>O
            large scale, and consequently generate
            serious problems for the production of food, the supply of water and the production of diverse goods for the
            humanity, benefits that depend on climate stability and biodiversity integrity. Those
            effects
            are closely interrelated, influence one another, amplifying their negative impacts and
            producing new factors for the intensification of global warming. Warming and its consequences
            will differ from region to region, and the Arctic is the region that is warming the fastest. nature and the
            range of these regional variations are still difficult to predict accurately, but it is known that none of the
            region
            of the world will be spared from change. Many will be heavily penalized, especially the poorest and most
            less resources for adaptation. Even if greenhouse gas emissions stop immediately, the temperature
            will continue to rise for a few more decades, as the effect of the emitted gases does not manifest itself immediately and
            they remain active
            them for a long time. It is clear that a drastic reduction in emissions will not happen soon,
            so there will be a need to adapt to the inevitable consequences of warming. Once the
            The consequences will be more serious the greater the emissions of greenhouse gases, it is important to start
            reduction of these emissions as quickly as possible, in order to minimize the impacts on this and future
            generations.
