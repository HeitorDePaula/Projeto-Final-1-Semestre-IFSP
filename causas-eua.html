        <h1>Greenhouse effect</h1>

        <p>
            The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon and makes human life possible on Earth.
            Part of the solar energy that reaches the planet is reflected directly back into space, upon reaching the top of the
            Earth's atmosphere - and part is absorbed by the oceans and the Earth's surface, promoting its
            heating. A portion of this heat is radiated back into space, but is blocked by the presence of gases.
            of greenhouse effect that, despite letting the energy coming from the Sun (emitted in wavelengths
            smaller), are opaque to terrestrial radiation, emitted at longer wavelengths. This difference in
            wavelengths is due to differences in the temperatures of the Sun and the Earth's surface.

            In fact, it is the presence of these gases in the atmosphere that makes the Earth habitable, because if they did not exist
            naturally, the average temperature of the planet would be very low, on the order of minus 18ºC. the exchange of
            energy between the surface and the atmosphere maintains the current conditions, which provide an average temperature
            global, near the surface, of 14ºC.

            When there is a balance between incident solar energy and reflected energy in the form of heat by the
            terrestrial surface, the climate remains practically unchanged. However, the energy balance can be
            altered in several ways: by the change in the amount of energy reaching the earth's surface;
            by the change in the orbit of the Earth or of the Sun itself; by the change in the amount of energy arriving at the
            Earth's surface and is reflected back into space, due to the presence of clouds or particles in the
            atmosphere (also called aerosols, which result from fires, for example); and finally thanks
            to the change in the amount of energy of longer wavelengths reflected back into space, due to
            changes in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

            These changes in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are taking place due to the increase in
            unsustainable increase in anthropogenic emissions of these gases.

            Greenhouse gas emissions occur in virtually all human activities and sectors of the
            economy: in agriculture, through the preparation of land for planting and application of fertilizers; at
            livestock, through the treatment of animal waste and the enteric fermentation of cattle; in transport, by
            use of fossil fuels such as gasoline and natural gas; in the treatment of solid waste, in the form
            how waste is treated and disposed of; in forests, through deforestation and forest degradation; and in
            industries, for the production processes, such as cement, aluminum, iron and steel, for example.</p>
     
    
        <h1>Relationship between Deforestation and Global Warming</h1>
        <p>Deforestation is one of the sources of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, in
            carbon dioxide – CO2. But an international team of scientists has identified another way by
            which deforestation contributes to global warming.

            According to the study, deforestation promotes the emission of CO2 through the burning and decomposition of material
            vegetation, leading to higher atmospheric concentrations. Thus, it contributes to the heating of the system
            climate change, because higher concentrations of greenhouse gases make the atmosphere retain more energy.

            At the same time, forests have a low albedo, absorbing a greater amount of solar radiation than
            than areas occupied by pastures or crops. Deforestation therefore leads to an increase in surface albedo.

            A greater amount of sunlight is reflected back into space, decreasing the amount of energy
            absorbed and contributing to the cooling of the climate system.

            In general, the deforestation of forests in tropical regions will contribute to the warming of the system
            climate change, as CO2 emissions outweigh changes in albedo. On the other hand, those
            located in regions of higher latitude lead to a cooling, as the change in albedo exceeds the
            emissions. By calculating the global impact of deforestation, the result is a contribution to
            the heating.</p>
